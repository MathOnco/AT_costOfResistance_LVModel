This repository contains the code to generate the figures in our research paper: Strobl et al (2021), [*Turnover modulates the need for a cost of resistance in adaptive therapy*](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/81/4/1135) published in *Cancer Research*. A pre-print of this paper is available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/29/2020.01.22.914366.full.pdf). 

For each figure, as well as for the ingredients for the cover image, there is a dedicated Jupyter notebook. The files in the `utils` folder contain all the main functions for simulating the model and plotting its results.

To run run the code, install the required dependencies via
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then start a jupyter notebook and fire away.
